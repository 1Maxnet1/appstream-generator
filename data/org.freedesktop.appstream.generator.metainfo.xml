  <name>AppStream Generator</name>
  <summary>A fast AppStream metadata generator</summary>

  <description>
    <p>
      AppStream is a metadata specification which permits software components to provide information about themselves
      to automated systems and end-users before the software is actually installed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>appstream-generator</em> tool generates AppStream metadata from the repositories of a software distribution.
      It currently supports the following repository formats / distributions: Debian, Ubuntu, Arch Linux, RPM-MD (Fedora, Mageia).
    </p>
    <p>
      The generator will produce AppStream catalog metadata files in the AppStream YAML or XML format to be shipped
      to users, as well as a detailed HTML report about found components and HTML and JSON reports on issues detected
      with the scanned metadata. It reads .desktop files as well as metainfo files, renders fonts, scales images, caches
      screenshots etc. to produce high-quality metadata for AppStream based software centers to consume.
      Usually, <em>appstream-generator</em> is integrated with the existing software build &amp; packaging workflow of
      a distribution.
