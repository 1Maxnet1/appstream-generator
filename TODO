= AppStream Generator TODO List =

=== Known issues ===

 * gnome-chemistry-utils: Contains broken tags (<metadata_license>CC0-1.0</metadata_licence>), but
   we do not emit any meaningful error (only that we can't parse XML, some more details would be nice).

=== Planned Features ===

 * Extract localizstion status for AppStream components and add them as
   `Languages` field.
 * Extract more metadata from things which do not have AppStream upstream
   metadata yet.
 * Add an icon-cache so we don't render SVG icons in themes multiple times.

=== Whishlist / Random Ideas ===

 * ???
